          <h2>City Exploration</h2>
         <p>City Exploration is one of the oldest cities in existence and still has remains from the Romans that once ruled this area more than 2,000 years ago. No need to make the trip to Rome to see the amphitheater, as there one right here and admission is free. The City of Malaga was not only influenced by the Romans but the Moors also once called this home as evidenced by the Alcazaba fortress palace. This example of Moorish influence was built around 1050 A.D. by the Hammudid dynasty. Although not as extensive as the Alhambra in Granada, there are still mosaic tiles, dungeons, and towers for visitors to enjoy. There are also beautiful gardens for strolling as well as stunning views of the Roman amphitheater below and the stunning port where cruise ships docks. Lovers of art won’t want to miss the exhibits of Malaga’s favorite son, Picasso. There are more than 200 pieces of art on display at the Museo Picasso. There are other works showcasing Roman, Islamic, and Phoenician cultures. Price of admission is  €10 euros and the museum is open most days from 10:00am to 6:00pm year round. </p>
