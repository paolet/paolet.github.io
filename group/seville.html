    <h2>Cathederal de Sevilla</h2>    
       <p>No visit to Sevilla would be complete without a visit to its most famous landmark and UNESCO World Heritage site, the Cathedral. The site of today’s Cathederal de Sevilla was originally a great mosque constructed by the Moors in the late 12th century. When the Christian Crusaders, led by Fernando III of Castile, invaded the city of Sevilla in 1248 the Almohad Mosque was consecrated as a cathedral. After the earthquake of 1356 occurred, the citizens rallied to rebuild the site with a church. Fernando III of Castile so admired the Moors’ architectural abilities, that the parts of the mosque that survived the earthquake were preserved. Today visitors’ can still explore some of the original areas of the mosque by entering the minaret, climbing the famous bell tower – Giralda, or strolling through the orange and cypress gardens in the Patio de los Naranjos. The best way to beat the long queues to enter the cathedral would be to join an organized free walking tour, such as https://www.freetour.com.</p>

       <p><strong>Plaza de España </strong> The Plaza de España, designed by Aníbal González, was a principal building built on the Maria Luisa Park's edge to showcase Spain's industry and technology exhibits. González combined a mix of 1920s Art Deco and 'mock Mudejar', and Neo-Mudéjar styles. The Plaza de España complex is a huge half-circle with buildings continually running around the edge accessible over the moat by numerous bridges representing the four ancient kingdoms of Spain. In the center is the Vicente Traver fountain. By the walls of the Plaza are many tiled alcoves, each representing a different province of Spain.[4]
Today the Plaza de España mainly consists of Government buildings. The central government departments, with sensitive adaptive redesign, are located within it. The Plaza's tiled 'Alcoves of the Provinces' are backdrops for visitors portrait photographs, taken in their own home province's alcove. Towards the end of the park, the grandest mansions from the fair have been adapted as museums. The farthest contains the city's archaeology collections. The main exhibits are Roman mosaics and artefacts from nearby Italica. The Plaza de España has been used as a filming location, including scenes for the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. The building was used as a location in the Star Wars movie series Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) — in which it featured in exterior shots of the City of Theed on the Planet Naboo.[5] It also featured in the 2012 film The Dictator.
The plaza is used as set for video clip of Simply Red's song "something got me started".
