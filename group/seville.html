          <h2>Cathedral de Sevilla</h2>  
         <p>No visit to Sevilla would be complete without a visit to its most famous landmark and UNESCO World Heritage site, the Cathedral. The site of today’s Sevilla Cathederal was originally a great mosque constructed by the Moors in the late 12thcentury. When the Christian Crusaders, led by Fernando III of Castile, invaded the city of Sevilla in 1248 the Almohad Mosque was consecrated as a cathedral. After the earthquake of 1356 occurred, the citizens rallied to rebuild the site with a church. Fernando III of Castile so admired the Moors’ architectural abilities, that the parts of the mosque that survived the earthquake were preserved. Today visitors’ can still explore some of the original areas of the mosque by entering the minaret, climbing the famous bell tower – Giralda, or strolling through the orange and cypress gardens in the Patio de los Naranjos. The best way to beat the long queues to enter the cathedral would be to join an organized free walking tour, such as <a href="https://www.freetour.com">Freetour.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Plaza de España</h2>
       <p>A short walk from the Sevilla Cathederal is the beautiful Plaza de Espana. The plaza was built in 1929 for the Ibero-American Exposition. The semi-circle structure has two bookend large towers and the middle are a series of painted ceramic tiled, azulejos, benches representing the provinces of Spain. Other architectural delights include fountains, wood ceiling paneling, carved marble, and wrought iron. The structure was completely constructed with red bricks that glow during sunrise and sunset. In addition, there is a beautiful canal that runs through pavilion with brick footbridges representing the original kingdoms of Spain. Visitors can also rent small boats to row in the canal or take a leisurely carriage ride. If the sun becomes too intense on a beautiful summer’s day, visitors can seek shade adjacent shaded park, Plaza de America or the Mudéjar Pavilion (Pabellón Mudéjar). The site has been showcased in several famous movies and T.V. shows including the Game of Thrones and Star Wars.</p>
