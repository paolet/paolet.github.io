          <h2>Plaza Mayor</h2>  
         <p>Although Plaza Mayor may not be as ornate as Plaza de Espana in Seville, it is a great place for visitors to stop and sip coffee, order a glass of tinto de verano, or just sit and people watch. Visitors can also be entertained by street magicians or actors posing as statutes in the square. This is also a great place to grab those last minute souvenirs or grab a bite to eat in a rather over-priced restaurant. One of the best places to have a tasty treat is Casa de la Panadería, which has been in existence since the 1600, and survived three fires. The square is located in the heart of Madrid and has a statute of Phillip III in the center, who reigned as King over Spain and Portugal between 1598 and 1621. Another famous sculpture in the Plaza is “The Bear and the Stawberry Tree”, the symbol of Madrid. There is also visitor’s center where visitors can pick up maps and find out about other area attractions. The Plaza Mayor is serviced by the Porta del Sol and Opera metro stops. </p>

          <h2>Royal Palace (Palacio Real)</h2>
         <p>Although the Royal Palace (Palacio Real) is not the official residence of Spain royalty, it is worth a visit. The Royal family resides outside of Madrid in the Zarzuela Palace.  Today, the Palace is used for official state affairs, such as ceremonies, dinners, other functions. Visitors are unable to tour the inside, but can marvel the beautiful structure from the outside. Across from the Palace lies the Palace Gardens, also known as the Campo del Moro. The Gardens have stood since the 18th Century and the main highlight of the Garden is the Fuente de las Conchas or Fountain of the Shells. Next to the Palace is the Almudena Cathedral; the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madrid. Visitors can reach the Palace, Gardens, and Cathedral via the Opera metro station stop. For a bird’s eye view of the Royal Palace and the City of Madrid, visit Temple de Debod, which, was gifted to Spain from Egypt in 1968 and has become a favorite place for locals to simply relax. The Temple is easily accessed via the Plaza de Españaor Ventura Rodríguez metro stops. </p>
